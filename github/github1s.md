# github1s One second to read GitHub code with VS Code

**Github1s** stands for **One second to read GitHub code with VS Code**

It's a small project that allows you to read a Github project with an online version of VSCode.

You need just add 1s after github and press Enter in browser address bar for any repository you want to read.

For example for the repository [https://github.com/matchabot/matcha-bot](https://github.com/matchabot/matcha-bot)

You add 1s to github and the address becomes [https://github1s.com/matchabot/matcha-bot](https://github1s.com/matchabot/matcha-bot)
