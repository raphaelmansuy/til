# 10 minutes to deploy a Docker App to AWS using ECS

AWS proposes two container orchestrations services: ECS and Kubernete.

Well integrated with the AWS ecosystem, ECS is the proprietary version.

## What we will build

In this tutorial we will explain how to:

- Package and build a node application and package a simple node application with Docker
- Create a ECR repository to store our Docker Image
- Upload the Docker image to the repository
- Create and launch an Elastic Container Cluster (ECR)
- Launch our application as a task within the Elastic Container Cluster
- Expose and open this application on internet

![Workflow Shema](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/schema01.png)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a technology that helps to package and ship applications easily in production.
- [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc&ecs-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&ecs-blogs.sort-order=desc) stands for Elastic Container Service. It is a fully managed container orchestration service
- [ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html) stands for Elastic Container Repository. ECR allows to storage of Docker Images on AWS.

Concepts:

- A cluster is logical grouping of hardware ressources.
- A task a set of metadata (memory, cpu, port mappings, environment variables, etc) that describes how a container should be deployed.
- Services are responsible to manage advance configuration such as load balancing

## The [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org) application to deploy

We want to deploy a basic express node application that displays the current time each time the index page is refreshed.

### `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "docker_web_app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js on Docker",
  "author": "RaphaÃ«l MANSUY raphael.mansuy+contact@gmail.com>",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

### `server.js`

```javascript
"use strict"

const express = require("express")

// Constants
const PORT = 8080
const HOST = "0.0.0.0"

// App
const app = express()
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello World - ${new Date().toISOString()}`)
})

app.listen(PORT, HOST)
console.log(`Running on http://${HOST}:${PORT}`)
```

## Package the nodejs application with a Docker file

In the same directory of this application we can create a `Dockerfile` that explains how to build a container with this application:

### `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM node:14
# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]

```

**This file defines the following steps:**

- start from the node:14 image
- create a directory `/usr/src/ap` inside the container
- copy the local file with pattern `package*.json` in the container
- run `npm install`
- copy all the local files to the container
- expose the port `8080` inside the container
- run `node` with the file `server.js` when the container starts

## Building the image

Run the following command to build an image with the tag `node-web-app`

```bash
docker build -t node-web-app .
```

## Running the image

Run the following command to start the application in detached mode:

```bash
docker run -p 80:8080 -d node-web-app
```

The container is now running and the 8080 port within the container is exposed as the 80 port on your local machine.

We can now test the application with the [CURL command](https://curl.se/)

```bash
curl http://localhost:80
```

Results:

```bash
Hello World - 2021-02-11T05:06:12.739Z
```

We are now ready to deploy this container to the cloud.

## Connect to AmazonECR

**Prerequisites**

- [`aws cli`](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) must be installed
- your [aws profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) must be configured and have ECS admin rights enabled

Run the following command:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login
```

If your have access you should have this display on the terminal:

```bash
Authenticating with existing credentials...
Login Succeeded

```

## Create your AmazonECR in the AWS Console

Connect to the AWS Console and to the ECS Administration screen to create a new repository.

![ECR Step1](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr1.png)

Click on **Create Repository** and choose `testrepository` as a name for your repository:

![ECR Step2](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr2.png)

The ECR repository is now created:

![ECR Step3](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr3.png)

## Upload the image on AWS ECR

Click now on the `push commands button` on the repository screen:

![ECR Step4](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr4.png)

Copy and execute each command on your machine:

![ECR Step5](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr5.png)

**connect**:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 3680199100XXX.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

**build**:

```bash
docker build -t testrepository .

```

**build**:

```bash
docker tag testrepository:latest 3680199100XXX.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/testrepository:latest
```

**push to ECR**:

```bash
docker push 3680199100XXX.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/testrepository:latest
```

The image is now published and available on ECR ready to be deployed:

![ECR Step6](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr6.png)

If you look at AmazonECR, repositories we can see the new created image.

![ECR Step6-1](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr6_1.png)

![ECR Step6-2](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr6_2.png)

Copy the image URI: we need to keep this to create a task definition for the following steps.

```
368019910004.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/testrepository:latest
```

## Create an ECS Cluster

Go to the ECS home page and click on the `create cluster` button:

![ECR Step7](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr7.png)

Choose `EC2 Linux + Networking` and then click next:

![ECR Step8](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr8.png)

Then enter the following information:

- name of the cluster: `ecs01`
- EC2 instance type: `t3-micro`
- Number of instances: `1`

![ECR Step9](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr9.png)

Then choose:

- Default VPC
- Auto assign IP: `Enabled`
- Security group: `default`
- Choose one of the subnet

![ECR Step10](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr10.png)

And then next press `Enter`

## Create a new Task definition

> A task a set of metadata (memory, cpu, port mappings, environment variables, etc) that describes how a container should be deployed.

Click on new `Task definition`

![ECR Step11](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr11.png)

Choose `EC2`

![ECR Step12](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr12.png)

Then `next`

Choose `NodeWebAppTask` for the name of the task definition.

![ECR Step13](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr13.png)

Enter `128`for memory size.

Click add container:

![ECR Step14](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr14.png)

- Add the name of the container: `NodeWebApp`
- Set the image URI that we have saved add the end of the `add image` step
- Set the port mappings 80:8080

![ECR Step15](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr15.png)

Click `create`.

![ECR Step16](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr16.png)

Then go to `Run Task`

![ECR Step17](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr17.png)

![ECR Step18](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr18.png)

The task is now running:

![ECR Step19](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr19.png)

If we click on the container instance:

![ECR Step20](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr20.png)

We can modify the security group associated with instance to open the port `80`

![ECR Step21](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr21.png)
![ECR Step22](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr22.png)

Add 80 in the inbound rule to the security group:

![ECR Step23](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr23.png)

If we try now to open the url: `http://ec2-52-38-113-251.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`:

![ECR Step24](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/til/raw/main/docker/images/ecr24.png)

## Et voilÃ 

Our clustor and node application is now deployed.
